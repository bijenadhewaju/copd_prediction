# COPD Prediction Project
This is a guided Project on the Predicting Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Nepal.

## Course and Guidance
AI Capacity Building Course by Omdena

### Description

Develop a comprehensive system for predicting Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), you'll need to follow a structured approach that includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and deployment. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to go about building a predictive system for COPD as a data scientist:

To predict the likelihood of a patient developing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) based on various risk factors and patient characteristics.

#### Objectives:

1. Collect and preprocess data relevant to COPD.
2. Identify and engineer significant features contributing to COPD.
3. Develop a predictive model to estimate the risk of COPD.
4. Evaluate the model's performance and refine it.
5. Deploy the model for practical use in a clinical or public health setting.
